## Getting started

### Prerequisites  
- `OneOf Unity` package installed in the project

- Make sure the `OneOf Unity` package is installed
- Click the plus [+] symbol in the top left corner of the window
- Click "Add package from git URL..."
- Paste in `https://github.com/Simply-Cods/OneOfUnity.git?path=/OneOfUnity.Extended#latest` (you can specify your desired version by replacing 'latest')

## Usage

This package just adds more `OneOf` types that accept from 10 to 32 generic parameters. This amount of parameters are rarely used, so they were separated into this package. Their usage is the same as in the `OneOf Unity` package.
